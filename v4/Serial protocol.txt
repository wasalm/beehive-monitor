Communication between Rpi -> Arduino:

   Reset:
      R\n

   Get Serial Id:

      S\n

   Configure Device:

      Variable length:
         1: 'C'
         2 - 3: Device Id
         4 - 5: Primary port, in capital, if i2c write 'II'
         6 - (n-1): name of device, can be:
            BME280
            SSD1306
            HX711
            DS18B20
         n: '\n'

   Retreive data:

      4 bytes: 
         1: 'G'
         2-3: Device Id 
         4: '\n'

      Example:
      GD4\n

   Set Font request: (NOT implemented)

      'FXXYYY\n' where XX is the ID and Y is name of font

   Empty display request:

      'EXX\n' where XX is the ID

   Draw string request:

      'WXXYZWW...W\n' where XX is the ID and Y is the x position in HEX, Z is the y position in hex and WW...WW is the string
      X is between 0 and 15(F) and Y is between 0 and 7.
      Request can be at most 255 long (incl. new line)

   Request free memory:
      'M\n:'

Communication between Arduino -> Rpi

   Reset response:
      "R\n";
   
   Error response:

      Variable length:
      Starts with 'E' and ends with '\n'
      Between is readable string.

   Configure response:

      5 bytes: 
         1: 'C'
         2-3: Device Id
         4: 0 fail, 1 succes
         5: '\n'
      
   Get response:

      Starts with 'GXXY\n' where XX is the ID and Y is 0/1 for succes and fail
      After that data will be returned starting with a letter denoting type and after that the value.

   Set Font response:

      'FXXY\n' where XX is the ID and Y is 0/1 for succes and fail

   Empty display response:

      'EXXY\n' where XX is the ID and Y is 0/1 for succes and fail

   Draw string response:

      'WXXY\n' where XX is the ID and Y is 0/1 for succes and fail

   Free memory response:
      'MXX..X\n:' where XX is amount of free memory

   Get SerialId response: 
      'SXX..X\n:' where XX is the serial id
